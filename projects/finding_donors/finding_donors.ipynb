    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "## Preparing the Data\n",
    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "### Transforming Skewed Continuous Features\n",
    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "**ANSWER**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Support Vector Machine:**\n",
    "- **Real world application:** Predicting whether a stock price will increase or decrease (https://www.cs.princeton.edu/sites/default/files/uploads/saahil_madge.pdf)\n",
    "- **Strengths:** It may rely on relatively fast and effective optimization methods since it has no local minimum (http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~epxing/Class/10701-08s/recitation/svm.pdf) despite the fact that it ends up supporting itself on a relativelty small subset of data points. It works well when vectors in different classes inhabit visibly different regions.\n",
    "- **Weaknesses:** It does not work very well when the classes are not easy to separate by region, and may end up requiring overly complex kernels and thus overfitting in those cases (no reference - personal observation).\n",
    "- **What makes it a good candidate:** Most of the features from the dataset are either very good indicators of income bracket (eg. work class, education level, occupation) or bear a small relevance for predicting income by themselves (eg. marital status, sex, race). This suggests that the two income classes may be nearly linearly separable with respect to this set of features.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Logistic Regression:**\n",
    "- **Real world application:** Predicting the risk of a patient to develop Coronary Heart Disease (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0021968167900823?via%3Dihub).\n",
    "- **Strengths:** It has similar advantages to those of an SVM with a linear kernel. Namely, it works well when classes can be visually split by a single hyperplane.\n",
    "- **Weaknesses:** Unless new features are manually added in terms of the original ones, it will fail to detect regions other than the sides of a hyperplane. For example, it would fail to separate a circular region from a disjoint ring around it.\n",
    "- **What makes it a good candidate:** Same reason as Support Vector Machine above. Especially under the observation that the income classes are likely to be linearly separable with respect to the given features.\n",
    "\n",
    "**K-Nearest Neighbors:**\n",
    "- **Real world application:** Predicting housing prices using a distance measure that takes into account the actual geographic distance of houses (http://rl.cs.mcgill.ca/comp598/fall2014/comp598_submission_99.pdf).\n",
    "- **Strengths:** Unlike the two methods above, no special consideration is needed for the shape of the regions defined by each class.\n",
    "- **Weaknesses:** It is relatively slow to run (since it needs to compute distances to all data points) and to optimize (since one needs to manually try different values of K and different functions for the distance measure).\n",
    "- **What makes it a good candidate:** It is expected that people with similar work type, occupation, hours per week, education level and year, have similar incomes. The addition of sex, race, and marital status would strenthen this relationship, since employment discrimination has been observed in some trades. Thus it is expected that data points with nearby vector representations share an income class, making k-nearest neighbors a good candidate for this problem."

    "The Logistic Regression model has the highest accuracy and f-score of the three models above. This suggests that it may be the most suited for the data. It also takes a negligible training and testing time, which is convenient for tuning. The suitability of this algorithm has been discussed above in the model application question: It is reasonable to assume that there's a somewhat linear correlation between many of the input features and the income of an individual. Thus we can be confident that the two income classes will be almost linearly separable with respect to the input data."

This way, when a new data point is provided, we simply need to check whether it falls into one region or the other, and thus give the desired answer, for example: \"This person is likely to have an income that is more than 50K\"\n",
    "\n",
    "[b] **VISUALIZING DATA POINTS:** You can visualize data points as literal points in a given domain. For example, if there is only one parameter, each data point is a point on a line. If there were only two parameters, data points would be points on a plane. And if there were three paratemers, data points would be points in 3d-space. Even though it is not possible to visualize them, higher dimensional spaces do exist, so we can similarly talk about 10-parameter data points being literal points in 10-dimensional space.\n",
    "\n",
    "[c] **SPLITTING THE SPACE:** A line can be split into two regions by a point. A plane can be split by a line. 3d-space can be split by a plane (much like a wall can split a room in two). Similarly, a 4-dimensional space can be split by a 3-dimensional space within it, even if this cannot be visualized as in the smaller examples. The splitting space may be referred to as a \"hyperplane.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "[d] **REDUCING A MODEL'S JOB:** This means that a model's job of splitting the set of data points into two regions (see [a], [b]) could be satisfied by providing a hyperplane (see [c]). This is exactly what the Logistic Regression classfier does.\n",
    "\n",
    "[e] **LOGISTIC REGRESSION:** The Logistic Regression model simply splits the space of all data points into two regions using a hyperplane. It does so by iteratively moving and rotating this hyperplane (you can still think of it as a wall splitting 3d-space) to simultaneously keep points from one class on one side, and points from the other class on the other side, as far as possible from the wall. Misplaced points, or points that are close to the hyperplane, help push it away or pull it closer a bit at every iteration. This process is called \"training.\" It turns out that there is always an optimal position for this hyperplane, since there is a numerical score assigned to each position.\n",
    "\n",
    "[f] **SUMMARY:**\n",
    "\n",
    "[f.1] **Training:** The **Logistic Regression model** sees data points as literal points on a line, a plane, 3d-space, or a higher-dimensional space (see [b]), and provides a \"hyperplane\" that splits it into two regions. In the case of 3d-space, for example, this hyperplane would be a plane (an infinite wall). This \"hyperplane\" is initially positioned at random, and iteratively moved so that the training set points (the ones for which we already know the output) of one [income] class remain on one side, and the ones from the other class remain on the other side. This is done by penalizing misplaced points, and pushing away or pushing the hyperplane accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "[f.2] **Prediction:** Once the hyperplane reaches (or nearly reaches) its optimal position, it is considered to be \"trained\" and can be used to predict the output for new data points, which is the ultimate job of the model. This is achieved by placing the data point in the space and verifying in which region of the hyperplane it falls. If it falls on the region corresponding to a specific class, then we predict that this new data point belongs to that class."

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
